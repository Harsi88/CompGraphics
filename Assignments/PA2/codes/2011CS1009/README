Every functionality in code is implemented as mentioned in the assignment.

Some additional features are listed below:
1.  'l' (Small l) to enable lighting
2.  'L' (Capital L) to disable lighting 
    *** You may want to disabe lighting in order to see the clear distinction between x and y and z axes where they are shown in different colors***
3. 'f' to shift to solid mode 
4. 'e' to shift to wireframe mode
    *** By default wireframe mode is enabled***
    
Initially z-axis is pointing outwards in the viewport, as a result some features might be difficult to differentiate. 
So, I would suggest to rotate the camera first and then apply other features in order to see clear distinction between them.

I haven't as such implemented 'gluLookat equivalent' but have defined three function which when used in some combinations performs
exactly same functions as gluLookat does. I am using these functions to implement everything in my code. Please refer to source-code for 
more detail. I hope you will consider these function as effective implementation for 'gluLookat equivalent'.

THANK YOU!!!
