Brown University IFS Archive

The database was compiled at Brown University 
by Morgan McGuire and Nick Musurca.

This database contains the raw geometric mesh data
from actual 3D models downloaded from the internet.
Many of the original files can be found at 3DCafe.com,
polycount.com, and in the graphics3d.com IFS database.

The meshes have not been "cleaned up"-- they accurately
represent real-world 3D models and the kinds of model
errors encountered with them.

It may be freely used for non-commercial purposes.
If using the actual meshes for a commercial purpose,
you should contact the copyright holders of the
original meshes in question.

IFS is a simple indexed face set format.  fileformat.txt
describes the format and the G3D library (g3d-cpp.sf.net)
contains code for loading it.
